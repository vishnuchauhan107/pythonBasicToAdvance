'''
I. Conditional Statements
1) if
if condition : statement
or
if condition :
statement-1
statement-2
statement-3
If condition is true then statements will be executed.
'''
'''2) if-else:
if condition :
Action-1
else :
Action-2
if condition is true then Action-1 will be executed otherwise Action-2 will be executed.

3) if-elif-else:
Syntax:
if condition1:
Action-1
elif condition2:
Action-2
elif condition3:
Action-3
elif condition4:
Action-4
...
else:
Default Action
Based condition the corresponding action will be executed.
'''

'''II. Iterative Statements
If we want to execute a group of statements multiple times then we should go for
Iterative statements.
Python supports 2 types of iterative statements.
1. for loop
2. while loop
1) for loop:
If we want to execute some action for every element present in some sequence(it may be
string or collection)then we should go for for loop.
Syntax:
for x in sequence :
body
where sequence can be string or any collection.

2) while loop:
If we want to execute a group of statements iteratively until some condition false,then we
should go for while loop.

Syntax:
while condition :
body
'''

'''III. Transfer Statements
1) break:
We can use break statement inside loops to break loop execution based on some
condition.

2) continue:
We can use continue statement to skip current iteration and continue next iteration.

3) pass statement:
pass is a keyword in Python.
In our programming syntactically if block is required which won't do anything then we can
define that empty block with pass keyword.
